# Lua Tutorials

I'm considering revisiting the Introduction to Lua article that I wrote *many* moons ago when I was working at CDIS. I also published it on Gamedev.net which eventually led to it becoming an actual published article.

Lots of things have changed in the 13 years since I wrote that article, so I wouldn't mind seeing what's new, what I didn't get around to adding and, in all honesty, getting back into doing some writing.
